**THIS IS MY INITIAL TEST DISCORD BOT**

To make the bot work on your end you
need to get nodejs and npm alongside
some npm packages: nodemon & dotenv.

You need to make a .env file containing
your bot token and then tweak some bot
settings and so on.

## CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INTERACTION COMMANDS: `/quote`, `/quotelist`, `/tieup`
